    <h1>Stuff I do</h1>

    <p>Yeah, comics! I have had the honor and pleasure to work as a freelance proofreader on all sorts of <strong>comic books</strong> over the
      years — diary comics, mythologies, workbooks, anthologies — and with the amazing creators behind each of them.</p>

    <h2>Web Developer &#128187;</h2>

    <h2>Public Transit Budget Committee Member &#128653;</h2>

      <h2>More about me</h2>
      <p>When I'm not working or volunteering, I enjoy playing pickleball with my mom, laughing with my sister, coloring
        with my niece, being emotionally vulnerable with my friends, reading sci-fi, tending to my 35+ houseplants,
        dreaming of a solarpunk future, drawing birds, and admiring moss on sticks.</p>
