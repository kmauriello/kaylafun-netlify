    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <p>Welp, the "about me" section is the hardest part and I placed it right at the top! As Vonnegut put it, "We are here on Earth to fart around," and I am fortunate enough to get to do that in beautiful Southern Oregon. When I'm not working or volunteering, I enjoy playing pickleball with my mom and sister, coloring with my niece, being emotionally vulnerable with my friends, exchanging loving affirmations with my partner, reading sci-fi, tending to my 35+ houseplants, dreaming of a solarpunk future, and admiring moss on sticks. Phew, I'm a lucky one!</p>
    
    <h2>Stuff I do</h2>
    <p>I am fortunate to embody a lot of roles in my life: partner, friend, auntie, sister, daughter, cat caretaker, and more.</p>
    <p>Here are some other roles I step into from time to time.</p>

    <h3><em>Technical Writer & Project Manager</em> &#128181; &#128752;</h3>
    <p>In my day job, I am a technical writer for a <strong>satellite communications</strong> company (cool space stuff, basically). In addition to writing how-to manuals and troubleshooting guides for hardware and software, I administer a knowledge base and perform the duties of scrum master for my team.</p>

    <h3><em>Comics Proofreader</em> &#128181; &#129412;</h3><span class="emoji"></span>
    <p>Yeah, comics! I have had the honor and pleasure to work as a freelance proofreader on all sorts of <strong>comic books</strong> over the
      years — diary comics, mythologies, workbooks, anthologies — and with the amazing creators behind each of them.</p>
    <p>Awesome clients include the folks at <a href="https://www.tintopress.com">Tinto Press</a>, <a href="https://comics.cca.edu/">California College of the Arts</a>, and <a href="https://www.whyalwayswins.com/">Why Always Wins</a>.</p>

    <h3><em>Master Climate Protector (MCP)</em> &#127758;</h3>
    <p><strong>Southern Oregon Climate Action Now (SOCAN)</strong> offers a wonderful 10-week, 30-hour program to certify participants as an MCP, all in an effort to encourage everyday folks to feel confident about advocating for personal and political action related to climate change adaptation and resilience. To continue what I learned in the MCP program, I joined the SOCAN <strong>Medford Climate Action Team (MCAT)</strong>.</p>

    <p>If you're really interested, I'll give you a zine if you <a href="mailto:kmauriel@gmail.com">send me a note</a>. &#128522;</p>
