    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <br>
    <h3><em>Do comics really need proofreading?</em></h3>
    <p>Yes! Just like any other publication, comics can always benefit from a review for spelling, consistency, and clarity.</p>
    <br>

    <h3><em>Do you work with publishers or individual creators?</em></h3>
    <p>Both! I have worked one-on-one with creators, and I have also worked with publishers who review my notes before sharing them with the creator.</p>
    <br>

    <h3><em>What does the proofreading process look like?</em></h3>
    <p>You send me a PDF or physical copy of your comic, then I review it and provide notes. We can work out any other details together.</p>
    <br>

    <h3><em>Do you work on comics as your full-time job?</em></h3>
    <p>That would be neat! No, I have a day job as a technical writer for a satellite communications company. It's cool.</p>
    <br>

    <h3><em>How much do you charge?</em></h3>
    <p>Well, every comic is unique so pricing isn't as easy as setting a flat page rate. I would be happy to send you a quote based on your comic!</p>
    <br>

    <h3><em>How many cats do you have?</em></h3>
    <p>Only two! Brothers Sonny and Sterling like to keep me company while I read comics.</p>

    <blockquote>"Kayla, yeah, I know her. She’s the one with an inhuman ability to find mistakes that mere mortals wouldn’t catch if their lives were at stake. The thing is, she’s also very sensitive to the notion of an artist’s creative license. Let me be clear. Spell check is a wonderful thing, but it isn't nearly enough for a professional product. I can’t recommend Kayla's services enough. She has proofread nearly every book I’ve ever published, and I’m only ever disappointed when for some reason I don’t implement her changes. Do yourself a favor: get a haircut, make your bed, brush your teeth and have Kayla proofread your comics."

    <blockquote>"Kayla did a truly amazing job as editor for my graphic novel. She made the whole process painless. Her feedback was always thoughtful and constructive. My work would not have been complete without her input. I’m so glad to have worked with Kayla and I am eager to work with her again on my next project."

    <blockquote>"Kayla was highly recommended by a comic professional to edit Why Always Wins the book. Kayla stepped into the role with passion for the subject and a high level of professionalism. She meticulously reviewed the material and provided clear and actionable instructions to improve the copy. She was creative and clever in her suggestions to improve the structure, voice, and tone of the writing. She was very respectful of the overall narrative and core content, while guiding improvements. I would highly recommend Kayla for creative collaborations in writing."
